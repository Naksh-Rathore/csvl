Â # CSVL: CSV Language

---

## Overview

A SQL interpreter for querying `.csv` files, given in a `gdb`-style TUI. Tables can be given, queried, edited. 
This project will be optimized as much as possible to work on bigger files, so it can theorectically be given as a *"database"*.
I feel like `.csv` files should be interacted more with SQL, and this project will help that. Also, I am making this to help
me learn C++, and this project will teach me **pointers**, **file handling**, **string handling and manipulation**, **optmization**, and more.
